# blueAI — Scratchpad
Inline correction-resolution log. One line per correction the moment it's
resolved. Promoted to decisions.md / taste.md at audit passes, then wiped.

**All three threads were promoted at the 2026-08-01 pass:**

1. **The design-system thread** (2026-07-24 → 08-01) — promoted earlier that day: taste rules 38-41,
   4 decisions rows, 3 reasonings principles, 2 knowledge-base sections, Session 12.

2. **The tranches + switcher thread** (2026-08-01) — promoted this pass: taste rule 41 *widened* from
   text roles to component states, 5 decisions rows, 3 reasonings principles ("a measured number belongs
   only in the thing that measures it", "if a style is state-dependent, the state is a test dimension",
   "new verification tooling is wrong until diffed against something known-good"), Session 13, and the
   S9-S12 era written into evolution.md — which had been 4 weeks stale and still pointed at a
   /moneymaker build that never started.

3. **The parity-audit thread** (cont. 11-17) — its **method lessons** are now promoted, after being
   deferred across three sessions on the grounds that consolidating an in-progress audit risks recording
   it wrong. That reasoning held for its *findings* and still does. It did not hold for its *methods*,
   and deferring them had a measurable cost: the thread's single most-repeated lesson — a hand-written
   summary drifting from the generated data it summarises, hit three separate times — recurred a fourth
   time on 2026-08-01 in `blueai/CLAUDE.md`, in a different file, while the lesson sat unpromoted in
   this scratchpad. A lesson that is only written down where nobody reads it is not written down.

   > **The audit's FINDINGS remain open and are NOT closed by this promotion.** The state-machine
   > coverage matrix, the 220-instance manifest, and findings LB-01/02/05/06 (retained pending
   > re-confirmation) are all still in progress. Nothing here should be read as that work being done.

**Watch next session:** Gate 6.5 (Generalization Probe) did not run on rule 41, which is why a rule that
already covered a live bug never fired. Run 6.5 on every rule *promoted*, not only on new work.
