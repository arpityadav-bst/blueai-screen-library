## Session 2 — 2026-06-11 — Deployed to GitHub + Vercel; 2 prod build fixes; full audit
**Mode:** active (deploy + bug-fix + audit pass)

**Shipped:**
- **Deployed blueAI like WSUP** — GitHub `arpityadav-bst/blueai-screen-library` (public) + Vercel
  `blueai-screen-library.vercel.app`, git-connected auto-deploy (same Vercel team as WSUP). See
  project-insights → Deployment.
- **Fix 1 (build):** the 3 legacy scenes' `init(v?: object)` helper failed the prod `next build`
  typecheck (passed in dev) — typed it `TargetAndTransition`. Caught only by Vercel's strict TS.
- **Fix 2 (prod-only CSS):** Stage hero heading + agent-scene text rendered CENTER on Vercel, LEFT
  in dev. Root cause: production CSS chunking leaked hero-cards.css's generic `.hero{text-align:center}`
  onto `/hero/stage`; `.hero-right` inherited it. Guarded with `.hero-right{text-align:left}`
  (own-declaration → order/chunk-independent). Verified on the live bundle.

**designer_caught_count:** 1 — the Vercel text-align mismatch (a prod-only bug dev never showed).

**Audit (this session):** promoted the full 2026-06-10 build-session scratchpad (~20 entries) + the
S2 fixes → taste rules 14–18, knowledge-base (Spotlight + Motion/framer + CSS-architecture + mobile
+ token/layout hygiene + Components), decisions.md (6 rows), project-insights (CSS-arch finding +
Deployment). **Entered Phase 2** (Confirmed-correction era). Scratchpad wiped. Build green (no code
change since the verified-green build after Fix 2).

**Watching next session:** scope the hero stylesheets under unique root classes (the proper CSS-leak
fix — the named recurring category); retune hero motion timing vs the original.

## Session 1 — 2026-06-10 — Project bootstrapped + full marketing site built
Bootstrap: notebook created this session (first blueAI touch). Taste seeded from the
Claude-design export's designer-authored DS README.

**designer_caught_count:** not yet itemized — designer reviewed the Recommended hero
("a few things aren't right", parked in `design-source/FIX-LATER.md`) and confirmed the
variant-animation handling, then asked me to complete the rest autonomously.

**What built (all verified — `next build` GREEN, 6 routes):**
- Scaffold (Next 14 + React 18 + Tailwind 3.4 + TS + framer-motion) + the blueai-modern
  DS ported to tokens (`globals.css` `--bai-*` + `.bai-*`; `tailwind.config.ts`).
- Homepage (`BaiHome`): intro → 5 feature rows → Skills + Download CTA → 15-card All
  Skills grid → Powered-by → footer. Scoped CSS (`styles/homepage.css`).
- 3 hero directions: **`/` Stage (Recommended, RICH 2-scene agents)**, `/hero/3-cards`
  (LEGACY), `/hero/stage-original` (LEGACY big stage + rail). Agent motion rebuilt
  React-native (framer-motion, phase-driven) — Career/Creator/Finance, rich + legacy.
- `/hero-options` chooser (schematic previews + UX pros/cons + ★Recommended).
- `/style-guide` (colors · type · spacing/radius/elevation · components).
- Handoff docs (README/HANDOFF) + registered blueAI in the root CLAUDE.md VDA bootstrap.

**Decisions (see decisions.md):** rich-vs-legacy split confirmed (Stage=rich; the other
two=legacy, shared scenes); React-native motion over GSAP; per-route-scoped hero CSS +
full-nav `<a>`; marketing sections as scoped CSS, DS as Tailwind tokens.

**Verification:** production build green (6 static routes); each route screenshotted at
1440 (homepage, all 3 heroes, options, style-guide) — all render faithfully.

**Watching for next session:** enumerate + fix the parked Recommended-hero items; retune
hero motion timing vs the original; first real correction cycle → promote taste from
DS-seed to confirmed.
